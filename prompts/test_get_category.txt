**other:**
* **Focus:**  Miscellaneous content that doesn't fit into any other category.


**How to Categorize:**

1. **Focus on the core purpose of the post:** Is it about immediate rewards for simple tasks? A new project launch? Updates on an ongoing project? Updates to a node? Or the outcome of a past event?
2. **Look for key words and phrases:** "upcoming," "launch," "future," "beta," "waitlist," "early access," "complete all tasks," "submit address," "done!"  These can help you decide between "fast_airdrop," "new_project," and "update_project."
3. **Consider the timeline:**  If the post is about something that has already happened and the focus is on rewards, it's likely a "result."  If it's about something that needs to be done to participate in a project, it could be a "fast_airdrop" or "update_project."
4. **Pay attention to the technical details:** If the post is about instructions for setting up or maintaining a node, it's an "update_node."
