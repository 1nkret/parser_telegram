Category Descriptions:

new_node:
Posts announcing a new node.
Information about chain rewards.
Software relevant for hosting nodes.

update_node:
Posts tagged with #update.
Node updates for hosts.
Content involving software updates or shell commands.
Content includes code or shell commands

irl_post:
Real-life related posts that may include photos or text discussing life experiences.

result:
Posts sharing balances, updates, or results of completed work.
Profit-related posts.

reminder:
Posts tagged with #reminder.
Information about helpful software or projects that assist with interacting with crypto.
Posts reminding users of ongoing issues or project updates.

fast_airdrop:
Posts related to fast airdrop events or announcements involving limited-time opportunities, such as free or low-cost mints for NFTs or tokens, requiring minimal user engagement to receive benefits. The focus is on rewarding participants quickly without further development or coding requirements. Posts with straightforward tasks like minting one NFT to gain access or benefits should be categorized as an airdrop.

fast_airdrop:
Posts that offer quick, limited-time events where users can complete simple tasks like minting an NFT or claiming tokens for small fees or no cost, in exchange for immediate rewards or benefits. These events often have short windows and do not involve long-term project development or coding tasks. Airdrops typically focus on rewarding early participants for minimal involvement, such as paying a small fee for an NFT mint that grants access to a game or test.

new_project:
Posts introducing new platforms, products, or projects tagged with #update. These posts often describe ongoing development or long-term plans for a platform, which may require significant user involvement or tasks that contribute to future project updates and enhancements.

Descriptions of project milestones or achievements.
Announcements about shifts in project strategy or scope.
Updates about team contributions, project schedules, or management-level decisions.
Important: update_project content must not include any technical details related to nodes, shell commands, or code snippets.

update_node:
Posts in the update_node category are focused on updates specifically related to nodes or technical hosts. This includes detailed and technical content involving:
Software updates and patches for nodes.
Shell commands and command-line instructions.
Code snippets or configurations related to maintaining or updating nodes.
Step-by-step guides for technical updates or troubleshooting node issues.
Important: update_node content may include code, technical commands, or specific instructions directly related to node maintenance and updates.

IMPORTANT!!! Difference between **update_node** and **update_project** based on these criteria:
- Classify as **update_node** if the post contains technical details such as shell commands, configuration files, or instructions for updating nodes.
- Classify as **update_project** if the post provides general project information, task links, or non-technical instructions, without any technical details.
Analyze the text below and choose the appropriate category.

IMPORTANT!!! Difference between airdrop and new_project based on these criteria:
Classify as airdrop if the post involves immediate rewards in exchange for simple, short-term actions. For example, minting an NFT or completing a quick task (such as following a social media account) that directly leads to instant rewards like access to an event or a game. Airdrops often have small fees or involve minimal effort, and the rewards are immediate, typically without any long-term commitment from users.
Classify as new_project if the post involves pre-registration, waiting for a future event, or tasks that lead to future rewards or ongoing involvement in the project. This includes games, platforms, or projects that require user participation before a launch and typically involve future updates, developments, or tasks after the event. The rewards are not immediate but tied to the success or engagement with the project in the future.
Why Forge Studio is a fast airdrop:
The post asks users to mint an NFT (for a small fee of $0.3) and get access to a playtest later. This means the main action is a quick, one-time task (minting the NFT) that grants immediate access to an event in the future. It doesn’t involve a long-term commitment or ongoing user engagement in the project’s development, making it a fast airdrop.
Why Memecore Pre-Registration is a new project:
This post is about pre-registering for a game (waiting for launch), which does not provide immediate rewards. Instead, users are asked to check their account score, follow on Twitter, and wait for the game to launch. This involves future rewards and preparing for ongoing engagement with the game, making it a new project, as the rewards are tied to the project's success at launch, not immediate tasks.
This approach should help the AI understand the key distinctions:
Fast airdrop = Immediate task, small reward, quick participation.
New project = Pre-registration, long-term engagement, and future rewards.

Instructions for Categorization:
Read the description of the post.
Match the content with the most appropriate category based on the descriptions above.

Ensure your categorization is accurate and follows the defined guidelines. Do it several times to correct result.

And you have problems with difference update_node and update_project, do double check on this step.

Return please only key (example: "new_node", "fast_airdrop" etc)
