Find and extract the headline from the text that includes the project name. A headline is considered to be a line or paragraph that starts with a capital letter, includes one or more words (specifically containing the project name), and does not end with a period. The headline should stand out from other lines due to its structure or placement. Exclude lines containing only hashtags (e.g., #update), as they are not part of the project name. If no explicit headline exists, identify the project name logically from the text content. For instance, in the given text, 'PWR' would be recognized as the project name.

example text:
